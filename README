This implements a spatial tree matrix that can be used to implement the model 
about vegetation patterns described in this paper: 
http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v449/n7159/full/nature06060.html



To run the model, python server.py
and point to http://localhost:8000/



Dependencies:
bottle http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/
greenlet, gevent, and gevent-websocket.  They can all be installed easily with pip.
Gevent depends on libevent (not a python module, so you have to install it before calling pip install gevent).
  
For some reason, I had trouble until I built libevent from source, but your mileage may vary on that one. libevent is here http://libevent.org/
